# Zen Mode

An HDMI device that instantly switches TV content to calming videos when triggered by a remote control. Built on Raspberry Pi 5.

Codeveloping this project with my children and Claude.

## What It Does

Press a button on your TV remote → TV switches from live content to a serene video (ocean waves, forests, etc.). Press again to return. Designed for family viewing situations where you want to quickly switch away from unexpected content.
